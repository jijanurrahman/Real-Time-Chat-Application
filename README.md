## Steps to Run the Project

**Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):** It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

- Install virtualenv (if you don't have it):
```bash
  pip install virtualenv
```
- Create a virtual environment:
```bash
  python -m venv venv
```
- Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS/Linux:
```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
```

**Apply Migrations:**
- Run migrations to set up the database schema:
```bash
  python manage.py migrate
```
**Create a Superuser (Optional):** If you want to access the Django admin panel or manage user profiles, create a superuser account:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
**Run the Development Server:**
- Start the Django development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
**Access the Project:**

- Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to access the project.

- If you created a superuser, you can access the Django admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ using the credentials you created.
